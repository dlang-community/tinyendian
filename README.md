Introduction
------------

TinyEndian is a minimal endianness library for the D programming
language. It has no external dependencies, it only needs a D compiler
and Phobos (standard library). TinyEndian doesn't allocate memory and is
fully **@nogc** to allow use in high-performance code.

The API is not stable and may change in the future.

Features
--------

-   Swap byte order of 2- or 4-byte elements in an array in place.
-   Read a UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32 buffer, determine its endianness
    using a UTF byte-order-mark and convert it to system endianness in
    place.
-   No external dependencies.
-   pure, nothrow and @nogc.

Directory structure

| `./`       | This README file, license, DUB package file. |
| `./source` | Source code.                                 |

Usage
-----

Assuming you use [dub], add this line:

    "tinyendian": { "version" : "~>0.1.0" }

to the `"dependencies"` in your project's `dub.json`.

If you don't use dub, you can directly copy the `source/tinyendian.d`
file into your project.

TinyEndian requires DMD 2.066 or equivalent GDC/LDC.
