------------
Introduction
------------

TinyEndian is a minimal endianness library for the D programming language.  It has no
external dependencies, it only needs a D compiler and Phobos (standard library).
TinyEndian doesn't allocate memory and is fully **@nogc** to allow use in
high-performance code.

The API is not stable and may change in the future.

--------
Features
--------

* Swap byte order of 2- or 4-byte elements in an array in place.
* Read a UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32 buffer, determine its endianness using a UTF
  byte-order-mark and convert it to system endianness in place.
* No external dependencies.
* pure, nothrow and @nogc.

Usage
-----

Assuming you use `dub <http://code.dlang.org/about>`_, add this line::

   "tinyendian": { "version" : "~>0.1.0" }

to the ``"dependencies"`` in your project's ``dub.json``.

If you don't use dub, you can directly copy the ``source/tinyendian.d`` file into your
project.

TinyEndian requires DMD 2.066 or equivalent GDC/LDC.

`API documentation <http://ddocs.org/tinyendian/~master/index.html>`_ can be found at
`DDocs.org <http://ddocs.org>`_.
